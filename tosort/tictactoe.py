#Tic-Tac-Toe, sometimes also known as Xs and Os, 
#is a game for two players (X and O) who take turns 
#marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who 
#succeeds in placing three respective marks in a 
#horizontal, vertical, or diagonal rows (NW-SE and NE-SW) wins the game.

#But we will not be playing this game. You will be the referee for 
#this games results. You are given a result of a game and you must 
#determine if the game ends in a win or a draw as well as who will 
#be the winner. Make sure to return "X" if the X-player wins and "O"
#if the O-player wins. If the game is a draw, return "D".
