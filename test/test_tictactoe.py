#Tic-Tac-Toe, sometimes also known as Xs and Os,
#is a game for two players (X and O) who take turns
#marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who
#succeeds in placing three respective marks in a
#horizontal, vertical, or diagonal rows (NW-SE and NE-SW) wins the game.

#But we will not be playing this game. You will be the referee for
#this games results. You are given a result of a game and you must
#determine if the game ends in a win or a draw as well as who will
#be the winner. Make sure to return "X" if the X-player wins and "O"
#if the O-player wins. If the game is a draw, return "D".

    # return 'X' if 'XXX' in all_results else 'O' if 'OOO' in all_results else 'D'
